<h1>:heavy_check_mark: 991. Broken Calculator</h1>
<blockquote>
There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:

* multiply the number on display by 2, or
* subtract 1 from the number on display.

Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.

* **Example 1**:<br>

        Input: startValue = 2, target = 3
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
      
* **Example 2**:<br>

        Input: startValue = 5, target = 8
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
