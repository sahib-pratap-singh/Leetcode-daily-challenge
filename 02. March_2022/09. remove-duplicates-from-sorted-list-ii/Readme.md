<h1>:heavy_check_mark: 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II</h1>
<blockquote>Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.</blockquote><br>

* **Example 1**:<br>
![List](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist1.jpg)

        Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
        Output: [1,2,5]
      
* **Example 2**:<br>
![List](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist2.jpg)

        Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
        Output: [2,3]


### **Constraints**

        The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
        -100 <= Node.val <= 100
        The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
